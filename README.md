# Tardis
A mod inspired by [Taridis_New](https://github.com/PiDemon/Taridis_New), using extra features and complete redesign from ground up.

## Todo:

> Last Updated: 01/15/2022

- [x] Build Mod Storage Structure
- [ ] Build more sophisticated placement of tardis interior schematic (Focus on more better placement coding)
- [ ] Support Tardis_New's Exterior textures (Also complete the color choices)
- [ ] Add support for Interior Dark/Light Theming (Just to add extra decor choices)
- [ ] Merge X/Y/Z Consoles into one Navigation Console
- [ ] Support Dematerialized state (There is no exit, there for the tardis seals the door, but allows essentially unacceptability (Unless someone knew the interior pos)
- [ ] Rework Re-materialization to call a load_map routine so the tardis can be used for exploration (Thank you voxel manip)
- [ ] Support more advanced healing and even support passive repairing of tools (detect if technic is installed and then charge power tools too)
- [ ] Redesign Taridis_New's Rotor to support greater than 10 power, and manage power generation/power consumption (I.E. Passive heal and Passive repair/recharge cost power)
- [ ] **Support directional placement** (Allow the controls to not face only one direction, same with the Tardis itself)

## Future:

> These plans may not ever occur, but are written down so if someone else wanted to help contribute (fan art, what not) feel free.

* K9 (As entity, when entering the Tardis it greets it's owner)
* Cloister Bell (Possibly to indicate Tardis damage, and possibly even low power)
